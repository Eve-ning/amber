## :star: [Release v0.0.1a happened](https://github.com/Eve-ning/amber/releases)

## Currently Working On...

#### Advanced Adjuster
A new experimental tool, more info when I'm done

#### Recreation of Project Skeletal
I think it's important to state that I'm currently still working on this project, I'm currently building a better framework/skeletal for this whole project so that it's more flexible. A lot of back-end changes are expected.
### [Skeletal Repo](https://github.com/Eve-ning/amber_base)

### Estimated Time of Project Completion
Feb 2019

## Purpose

This program is designed to be as user-friendly as possible, removing most uncommon terminologies and simplifying the process of mapping osu!mania maps.

## What it does

It includes various tools to help you in mapping:

- Stutter
- Copier
- Two Point Function
- Normalizer
- Adjuster
- Pack Splitter
- *more to come...*

Currently there are more SV/BPM related tools rather than general ones since there are already existing tools for most of what I have in mind.

## Future Updates

In the future I'll be focusing more on general tools and possibly extending the reach of these SV/BPM tools towards more experienced mappers.

Possible tools that I'll implement are all listed in the wiki.
