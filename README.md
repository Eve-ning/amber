## :star: [Release v0.0.1b happened and is being delayed sorry (copier issues)](https://github.com/Eve-ning/amber/releases/tag/v0.0.1-beta)

## Purpose

This program is designed to be as user-friendly as possible, removing most uncommon terminologies and simplifying the process of mapping osu!mania maps.

## What it does

It includes various SV tools to help you in mapping:

- Stutter
- Copier
- Two Point Function
- Normalizer
- Adjuster

## Future Updates

In the future I'll most likely come back to this and work on another tool from scratch again

## Hindsight

What I realized was happening was that there were too much code to look after and maintain, sieving through all of them was taxing and pretty much slowed my progress to a halt. So I pretty much ended up "giving up".

This doesn't mean that the program is useless at this point, it has done all it can do for beginner mappers and went well in hindsight. I don't think I'm capable of doing big things, I'll have to let go for now.

I'll be working on something else, so I might come back to this. If I do, I'll make sure there are more things to expect, but as of now, this is what I have to offer.
