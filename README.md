# re:amber
re:amber is a rework of amber, which was discontinued.

# status of project
apologies if it seems like I abandoned it again, I promise it's not the case. I usually take breaks after a long project, so take this as a small hiatus after the first rework of re:amber.

I'll come back whenever I feel like it, it'll be definite, but I just won't know when.
